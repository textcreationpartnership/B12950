            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>❧ A Proclamation concerning the execution of the Lawes against Recusants.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas vpon the humble Aduice of Our Lords and Commons in Parliament, Wee resolued to put the Lawes in execution against Iesuites, Priests, and Popish Recusants, and by their iust forfeitures accruing vnto vs, to encrease Our Reuenue towards the defraying of those extraordinary Charges for the publique Defence of Our State, which necessarily doe lie vpon Vs, which Our determination Wee haue already published vnder Our great Seale of <hi>England,</hi> and caused the same to bee enrolled of Record in Our great Courts of Iustice: And that Resolution then taken by Vs, Wee haue since pursued in such measure, as for the present Wee could, and intend constantly to proceede therein with as much care and speede, as by the industry of Our Officers and ministers of Iustice the same can be effected, which being a worke of time, cannot at once be begun and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected: Yet because we found diuers of Our Subiects, being Recusants, apt to complaine, that the Lawes made and in force against them, if they should all bee strictly exacted, are so hard and seuere in diuers points, that the seuerall penalties and punishments which they must incurre, and vndergoe, would vtterly disable them and their families in their very subsistence, whereby many of them must become a burthen to the place where they liue, and yet Our Profite would be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing encreased thereby:</p>
            <p>Wee tooke their humble Petitions in this behalfe into Our serious and Princely considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; being desirous in all things to cary Our Selfe towards all Our Subiects with that Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and moderation, as is fit for a iust and a good King; For Our better instructions herein, by Our Commission vnder Our great Seale, Wee directed diuers of Our Lords, and others of Our Priuie Counsell, to take these things into their due consideration, and to aduise and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme Vs in what things Wee might giue conuenient ease to the Recusants, without slacking the due prosecution of Our Lawes against them, or encouraging them thereby to persist in their errors, and without the destroying that part of Our Reuenue, which might fitly bee raised by their forfeitures, from which Our Commissioners, Wee haue receiued such aduice, as that thereout wee haue drawen Instructions and Directions vnto Our Commissioners imployed by Vs, which We haue recommended vnto them vnder Our Royal Hand, and which We purpose shall in the substance thereof bee obserued by them in the ordering of that Seruice.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:185656:2"/>
            <p>Now, lest this Our Clemency and Moderation might bee misconstrued, and the one part of Our Subiects obnoxious to Our Lawes in this case might flatter themselues, as if We could by any importunity be drawne to silence Our Lawes against them, and the other part of Our Subiects Conformeable to Our Lawes, and the true and orthodoxe Religion professed by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> might be possessed with some diffidence, lest Our Zeale and Constancy in Our Religion were cooled or abated, Wee haue thought fit hereby to make this publike De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, whereby all sorts of Our Subiects may discerne, and be assured of Our cleere inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion herein, and that Our full resolution is not to decline from Our first purpose and promise for the due execution of Our Lawes in this case, nor will not at any time hereafter bee mooued, by any whosoeuer, to that purpose; and yet that We shall proceede therein with such moderation, as the whole world shall beare witnesse with Vs, that Wee seeke their conuersion, and not their ruine.</p>
            <p>And whereas amongst other things, which Wee haue directed in the fauour of the Recusants, that we are contented, that they themselues, or their friends for them, may take leases of Our two parts of their Lands, which by the strictnes of the Lawes is denied vnto them, so as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes they render vnto Vs for the same as great a Rent, at the least, as any other would giue; Lest this also should receiue a misinterpretation, and turne to the preiudice of Our seruice, Wee doe hereby publish and declare Our will and pleasure to be, that all such Leases of Recusants lands, as haue beene already contracted for, and for any defect in the proceedings, or otherwise are not yet passed, or not effectually passed vnder Our Seales, shall be proceeded in according to those contracts; and for all other lands yet to be contracted for, that the Recusants themselues, or some for them, within three moneths after the date hereof, shall make their Compositions with Our Commissioners for their owne Lands, or else it shall be free for any other to take the same; and that then, and in the meane time also, if any others shall make a better offer vnto vs for Our profit according to Our said Instructions, then the Recusant, or some other in his behalfe shall doe, that he shall be receiued. Of all which Wee will, that all Our louing Subiects, whom it may any wise concerne, doe take notice.</p>
